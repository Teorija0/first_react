      <p>
        Unlimited Void: Satoru Gojo, a prominent character in Jujutsu Kaisen,
        possesses one of the most potent Domain Expansions known as
        &quot;Unlimited Void.&quot; This exceptional technique immerses both the
        user and the target inside the Limitless itselfâ€”a vast void filled with
        overwhelming information. The sheer volume of information incapacitates
        the target, rendering them immobile and defenseless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unparalleled Power: &quot;Unlimited Void&quot; stands as one of the most
        abstract and powerful domains in the series. The transcendental nature
        of this expansion showcases Gojo&apos;s omnipotence, making it
        challenging for adversaries to contend with the sheer force and
        complexity of the domain. Notably, Gojo is one of the few individuals
        capable of using Domain Expansion multiple times in a day, highlighting
        the rarity and mastery required for such a feat.
