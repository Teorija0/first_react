      <p>
        <span className="color">Unlimited Void</span>: <span className="color">Satoru Gojo</span>, a prominent character in Jujutsu Kaisen,
        possesses one of the most potent <span className="color">Domain Expansions</span> known as
        &quot;<span className="color">Unlimited Void</span>.&quot; This exceptional technique immerses both the
        user and the target inside the Limitless itselfâ€”a vast void filled with
        overwhelming information. The sheer volume of information incapacitates
        the target, rendering them <span className="color">immobile</span> and <span className="color">defenseless</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="color">Unparalleled Power</span>: &quot;<span className="color">Unlimited Void</span>&quot; stands as one of the most
        abstract and powerful domains in the series. The transcendental nature
        of this expansion showcases <span className="color">Gojo&apos;s</span>; omnipotence, making it
        challenging for adversaries to contend with the sheer force and
        complexity of the domain. Notably, <span className="color">Gojo</span> is one of the few individuals
        capable of using <span className="color">Domain Expansion</span> multiple times in a day, highlighting
        the rarity and mastery required for such a feat.
